<h1 align="center">Soy Boy Mod</h1>

This is my first ever mod for Bloons TD 6 (so bare with me) and it's meant as a test mod for me to make sure I could get everything working before I make more in depth mods. This mod adds in a new tower: Soy Boy who is a very unassuming character until he reaches his full potential. Upgrade him along one of his three paths to either stun MOABs, spawn clones, or obliterate Bloons with the powers of the infinity beans. Be careful though, as a new threat may arise if Soy Boy ever reaches his full potential.

In the Works:
- Updated artwork (portraits, icons, and projectiles)
- New Model designs
